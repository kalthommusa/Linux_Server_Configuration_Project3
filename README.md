# Linux Server Configuration Project

This is the last project for us as a students of Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree program.
 
## Introduction

This project is a good tutorial on how to build a secure server, install and configure a database server, and deploy a web application into it.

## Project Overview

A baseline installation of a Linux server [Amazon Lightsail](https://signin.aws.amazon.com) and prepare it to host [Item Catalog](https://github.com/kalthommusa/Item_Catalog_Project2) web applications.

## Amazon Lightsail

  1. First, log in to [Amazon Lightsail](https://signin.aws.amazon.com). If you don't already have an Amazon Web Services account, you'll be prompted to create one.

  2. Create an instance. Once you're logged in, Lightsail will give you a friendly message with a robot on it, prompting you to create an instance. A Lightsail instance is a Linux server running on a virtual machine inside an Amazon datacenter.

  3. Choose an instance image: Ubuntu Lightsail supports a lot of different instance types. An instance image is a particular software setup, including an operating system and optionally built-in applications. There are two settings to make here. First, choose "OS Only" (rather than "Apps + OS"). Second, choose Ubuntu as the operating system.

  4. Choose your instance plan. The instance plan controls how powerful of a server you get. It also controls how much money they want to charge you. For this project, the lowest tier of instance is just fine

  5. Give your instance a hostname. Every instance needs a unique hostname. You can use any name you like, as long as it doesn't have spaces or unusual characters in it. 

  6. It's running; let's use it! Once your instance has started up, you can log into it with SSH from your browser. 

The public IP address of the instance is displayed along with its name.

My public IP address of the instance is : 52.47.127.157
